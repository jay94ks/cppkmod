I'm sorry for pure build system....
It will be improved in future...

current build system is too much pure... I will improve that... sorry...

the build flow, see below:
	/Makefile -> /build/configure.sh				-> /sources/Makefile	-> /base/Makefile
				 /build/configure-cpp.sh sources	   /framework/Makefile
				 /build/configure-cpp.sh framework

!!: /Makefile will create the file, /base/.cpt.mod_def.c with the MODULE_NAME, MODULE_LICENSE and MODULE_AUTHOR.
the framework files is adaptive layer for supporting c++. 

if Linus Benedict Torvalds found this implementation,
	maybe....he will kill me with saying "fuck you!"....
